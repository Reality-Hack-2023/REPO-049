>Alzheimer's disease affects the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language, often resulting in impaired recall, thinking, communication, and behavior. By 2050, the number of Americans over the age of 65 with Alzheimers is expected to grow to a projected 12.7 million (source). VR has the potential to be an extremely valuable tool in this field of research.

>So, we created V/Recall. Changes in short term memory – forgetting words, names, or familiar tasks – is the first and most common sign of Alzheimer's. Our research-by-design VR solution has the potential to improve brain cognition through critical thinking and spatial exploration in a fun and immersive way.
